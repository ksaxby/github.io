He is working on an ARC-funded project investigating counter-covid policies on children's developmental outcomes and mental health. He holds a PhD in Economics (Health) from Monash Business School, Monash University.

His research interests draw from the intersection of health economics and labour economics. His primary area of interest focuses on the organizational features of the healthcare system, such as hospital competition and peer influence, that affect healthcare delivery. His secondary research focuses on development economics, where he was the co-PI of a JPAL-funded field experiment project on vaccine hesitancy.
